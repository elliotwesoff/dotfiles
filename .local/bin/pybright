# the idea is to use this script via berry hotkeys.
#
# we should be able to:
#
# 1. specify whether the brightness should go up or down
# 2. optionally give an increment (percentage) of how much
#    it should go up or down.
#
# the actual brightness adjustment can be done by
# writing to /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness
#
# we should also perform a check before writing the new
# value to the brightness file, to ensure we aren't
# trying to write a value that's higher than the maximum.
# the file /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/max_brightness
# contains a static integer representing the maximum number
# one can write to the brightness file.
